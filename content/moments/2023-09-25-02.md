My dear friend,

Today I realize that heart matters more than brain, as silence says more than words.

I can’t  say a word when silence say it well.

I can’t disturb the serenity when the truth reveals its veil.

But I can feel a lot more.

I feel trust when people reveal their weaknesses right in front of me.

I feel insecure when silence is too long between the sentences.

I feel the happiness and sadness flowing with the tears.

I feel myself reaching out to you for our connections.


Yesterday, I heard an explanation for the philosopher’s thoughts. 

When you feel deep, you feel much more pain.

But please try to feel, much more than see.

I hope everything feels brand new each morning.

I hope you feel your being  with all my wishes.

I hope you feel beauty when you feel my soul.
